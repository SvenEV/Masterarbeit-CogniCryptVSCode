# CogniCrypt for Visual Studio Code
A minimal Visual Studio Code extension hosting the CogniCrypt language server.
Based on the official [lsp-sample project](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/lsp-sample) discussed in the [Language Server Extension Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide).

## Running the Sample

- Run `npm install` in this folder. This installs all necessary npm modules in the client folder
- Open VS Code on this folder.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+B to compile the client.
- From the Debug viewlet, run the "Launch Client" config.
- In the [Extension Development Host] instance of VSCode, open a Java file and wait for CogniCrypt to report something.
